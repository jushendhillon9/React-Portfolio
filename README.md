Description: In this module challenge, I was tasked with recreating my second module challenge (my professional portfolio) using React. My portfolio features four different pages, showcasing my featured projects and challenges, offering a method of contacting me via a form, and a resume that highlights my range of front-end and back-end technologies that I can use. These pages can be navigated through the navbar, as shown in the image above. It also contains a footer with links to my github, linkedIn, and devTo blog posting account.
